# Testing Duplicate Fix - Coffee Change

## üîß What Was Fixed

### The Problem:
1. **Field mapping bug**: Code was using `tx.tx_hash` but API returns `tx.transaction_hash`
2. **No duplicate checking**: Every refresh created new records
3. **NULL tx_hash**: Database field was empty, couldn't detect duplicates

### The Solution:
1. **Fixed field mapping**: Now uses `tx.transaction_hash` correctly
2. **Added duplicate prevention**: Loads all existing tx_hashes into a Set before processing
3. **Detailed logging**: Shows exactly what's being inserted/skipped
4. **Skips whole numbers**: Doesn't insert transactions with $0.00 roundup

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Testing

### Step 1: Clean Up Old Data
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Delete all records with NULL tx_hash (broken records)
DELETE FROM base_batch_roundup WHERE tx_hash IS NULL;

-- Verify cleanup
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM base_batch_roundup;
```

### Step 2: First Load (Fresh Start)
1. Open your app: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Connect your wallet
3. Click "Open App" to go to dashboard
4. **Check browser console** - you should see:
   ```
   === SYNC START ===
   Wallet: 0x5AFD...
   Existing user found with ID: 3
   Existing transactions in DB: 0
   Fetching from Blockscout API...
   Total transactions from API: 5
   ‚úÖ NEW: 0xa10b3dce... amount: $1.5 roundup: $0.50
   ‚è≠Ô∏è  SKIP (whole number): 0x882339e... amount: $1
   ‚úÖ NEW: 0x7f8c4a2b... amount: $1.5 roundup: $0.50
   === SYNC COMPLETE ===
   ‚úÖ New transactions inserted: 2
   ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped duplicates: 0
   ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped whole numbers: 3
   üìä Total from API: 5
   ```

5. **Check database** - Should have 2 new records with:
   - `tx_hash` populated (not NULL)
   - Unique transaction hashes
   - Correct amounts

### Step 3: Refresh Page (Test Duplicate Prevention)
1. Press F5 to refresh the page
2. **Check browser console** - you should see:
   ```
   === SYNC START ===
   Existing transactions in DB: 2
   Total transactions from API: 5
   ‚è≠Ô∏è  SKIP (duplicate): 0xa10b3dce...
   ‚è≠Ô∏è  SKIP (whole number): 0x882339e...
   ‚è≠Ô∏è  SKIP (duplicate): 0x7f8c4a2b...
   === SYNC COMPLETE ===
   ‚úÖ New transactions inserted: 0
   ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped duplicates: 2
   ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped whole numbers: 3
   ```

3. **Check database** - Should STILL have only 2 records (no new duplicates!)

### Step 4: Refresh Multiple Times
1. Refresh 5 more times
2. Each time console should show: `‚úÖ New transactions inserted: 0`
3. Database should still have only 2 records

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Your fix is working correctly if:

- [x] **Console shows detailed logs** with emoji indicators
- [x] **First load**: Inserts new transactions only
- [x] **Subsequent loads**: Skips duplicates, inserts 0 new records
- [x] **Database tx_hash**: Populated with actual hashes (not NULL)
- [x] **No duplicates**: Same tx_hash doesn't appear multiple times
- [x] **Whole numbers skipped**: Transactions with $0 roundup not inserted

---

## üîç What to Check in Database

### Query 1: Check for NULL tx_hash (should be 0)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as null_count
FROM base_batch_roundup
WHERE tx_hash IS NULL;
```
**Expected:** `null_count = 0`

### Query 2: Check for duplicate tx_hash (should be 0)
```sql
SELECT tx_hash, COUNT(*) as count
FROM base_batch_roundup
GROUP BY tx_hash
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
**Expected:** No rows returned

### Query 3: View all records with details
```sql
SELECT
  r.id,
  u.wallet_address,
  r.tx_hash,
  r.usdc_amount,
  r.roundup_amount,
  r.status,
  r.created_at
FROM base_batch_roundup r
JOIN base_batch_user u ON r.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY r.created_at DESC;
```
**Expected:** Each tx_hash is unique, all have values (not NULL)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing NULL tx_hash
**Solution:**
- Old records had NULL because code was using wrong field
- Run cleanup SQL to delete those
- New records should have proper tx_hash

### Issue: Still getting duplicates
**Solution:**
- Check if UNIQUE constraint is applied:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE base_batch_roundup
  ADD CONSTRAINT unique_tx_hash UNIQUE (tx_hash);
  ```
- Constraint will block duplicates at database level

### Issue: No transactions inserted
**Solution:**
- Check if you have USDC transactions on Base Sepolia
- Check if all transactions are whole dollar amounts (roundup = $0)
- Check console logs for errors

## üéØ Final Verification

After testing, your database should look like this:

### base_batch_roundup table:
```
| id | user_id | tx_hash                        | usdc_amount | roundup_amount | status | created_at          |
|----|---------|--------------------------------|-------------|----------------|--------|---------------------|
| 15 | 3       | 0xa10b3dcee03a137ba2971987...  | 1.5         | 0.5            | false  | 2025-10-23 06:00:00 |
| 16 | 3       | 0x7f8c4a2b1d9e5f3c8a6b2d...    | 1.5         | 0.5            | false  | 2025-10-23 06:00:01 |
```

**Key Points:**
- Only 2 records (not 10+)
- tx_hash is populated
- No duplicates
- created_at shows when they were synced

**Your duplicate issue should now be completely fixed! üéâ**
