# ☕ Coffee Change - Save Money, One Coffee at a Time

**Micro-investing DApp that automatically rounds up your crypto transactions and invests the spare change into DeFi yield**

Built for Base Sepolia | Powered by Aave V3 | Chronicle Oracle Integration

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional saving is hard. People struggle to set aside money because:
- Manual saving requires discipline and constant decision-making
- Small amounts feel insignificant and get forgotten
- Crypto transactions make it even harder to track spending habits
- DeFi yield opportunities remain inaccessible to average users

**The result?** Millions miss out on building wealth through consistent, automated micro-investments.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**Coffee Change** makes saving effortless by automatically rounding up every USDC transaction you make on Base Sepolia. That spare change? We invest it into Aave V3's lending pools, earning you passive yield while you sleep.

### How It Works (In 30 Seconds)

1. **Spend** - Use USDC for your everyday purchases on Base
2. **Round Up** - We automatically round each transaction to the nearest dollar
3. **Accumulate** - Roundups pile up in your dashboard until you hit $1.00
4. **Invest** - When you reach the threshold, deposit ETH into our smart contract
5. **Earn** - Your ETH is automatically supplied to Aave V3, earning 5-8% APY

### Real Example

```
Coffee purchase: $4.35 → Rounds to $5.00 → $0.65 saved
Lunch: $12.80 → Rounds to $13.00 → $0.20 saved
Ride share: $8.45 → Rounds to $9.00 → $0.55 saved

Total accumulated: $1.40
✅ Ready to deposit and start earning yield!
```

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Blockchain**: Wagmi v2 + Viem
- **Wallet**: RainbowKit
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom glassmorphism design
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **API Integration**: Blockscout for transaction indexing

### Smart Contracts

#### **CoffeeChangeV2** (`0x449c5730788b0eebcbFF1D2935Ff107999328D61`)
Main contract handling user deposits and Aave integration.

**Key Functions:**
```solidity
function userDepositEth() public payable
```
- Accepts ETH deposits from users
- Tracks user positions and contribution timestamps
- Automatically supplies ETH to Aave V3 lending pool
- Sets 10-year withdrawal lock (incentivizes long-term saving)

```solidity
function supplyToAave(uint256 amount) internal
```
- Internal function that wraps ETH to WETH
- Supplies WETH to Aave V3 on behalf of the contract
- Earns variable APY (currently 5-8%)

**Storage Mappings:**
```solidity
mapping(address => UserPosition) public s_userPositions;
```
Tracks each user's deposits, Aave balance, and withdrawal timestamps.

#### **OracleReader** (Chronicle Oracle Integration)
Reads real-time ETH/USD price from Chronicle Oracle on Base Sepolia.

**Key Functions:**
```solidity
function getEthUsdPrice() external view returns (uint256)
```
- Returns current ETH price in USD with 18 decimals
- Used to calculate how much ETH is needed for roundup deposits
- Powers the deposit card's real-time price display

### Database Schema

**`base_batch_roundup` Table:**
```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- user_id: UUID (Foreign Key to auth.users)
- tx_hash: TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
- usdc_amount: NUMERIC(20,6)
- roundup_amount: NUMERIC(20,6)
- status: BOOLEAN (false = pending, true = deposited)
- created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
```

**Transaction Flow:**
1. User spends USDC on Base Sepolia
2. `/api/sync-transactions` fetches new transactions from Blockscout
3. Calculates roundup: `Math.ceil(amount) - amount`
4. Stores in database with `status = false` (pending)
5. Dashboard aggregates all pending roundups
6. When user deposits, `/api/mark-deposited` sets `status = true`
7. Portfolio page shows historical deposited roundups

### API Routes

#### **POST `/api/sync-transactions`**
Syncs USDC transactions from Blockscout to database.

**Features:**
- Triple-layer duplicate prevention (in-memory Set, DB query, UNIQUE constraint)
- First-time user handling (only snapshots latest transaction)
- Automatic roundup calculation
- Error handling and logging

**Request:**
```json
{
  "walletAddress": "0x123..."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Synced successfully",
  "newTransactions": 2
}
```

#### **POST `/api/get-roundups`**
Fetches pending roundups (status = false).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "roundups": [...],
  "totalPending": 1.25
}
```

#### **POST `/api/get-deposited-roundups`**
Fetches deposited roundups (status = true) for portfolio view.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "roundups": [...],
  "totalDeposited": 15.75
}
```

#### **POST `/api/mark-deposited`**
Marks all pending roundups as deposited after successful contract transaction.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "walletAddress": "0x123...",
  "txHash": "0xabc..."
}
```

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
node >= 18.0.0
npm or yarn
metamask wallet
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd coffee-change-base-batch

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

  tx_hash TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  usdc_amount NUMERIC(20,6),
  roundup_amount NUMERIC(20,6),
  status BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_user_status ON base_batch_roundup(user_id, status);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_tx_hash ON base_batch_roundup(tx_hash);
```

3. Enable Row Level Security (RLS):
```sql
ALTER TABLE base_batch_roundup ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own roundups"
ON base_batch_roundup FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own roundups"
ON base_batch_roundup FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
