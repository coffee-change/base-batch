# Portfolio Dashboard & Oracle Integration - Complete Summary

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Real Oracle Price Integration**
- Created `useOraclePrice` hook to read ETH/USD price from your Oracle contract
- Contract Address: `0x3590Fe3A70Aee3EeE7D07e6a15b02F089853B3b2` (Base Sepolia)
- Reads directly from Chronicle Oracle via your deployed contract
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Fallback to mock price if contract read fails

### 2. **Portfolio Dashboard** (`/portfolio`)
- New dedicated page to view **deposited** roundups only
- Shows roundups where `status = true` (already invested)
- Completely separate from pending roundups dashboard

### 3. **Dashboard Separation**
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Shows PENDING roundups (`status = false`)
- **Portfolio** (`/portfolio`) - Shows DEPOSITED roundups (`status = true`)

---

## 📊 Dashboard Structure

### **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - For Pending Roundups
**Purpose:** Track roundups waiting to be deposited

**Shows:**
- All pending roundups (`status = false`)
- Total pending roundups (sum)
- Deposit button (enabled when total >= $1.00)
- Real ETH price from Oracle
- Required ETH amount for deposit

**User Actions:**
- View pending transactions
- Deposit ETH when threshold reached
- After deposit → All pending marked as `status = true`

---

### **Portfolio** (`/portfolio`) - For Deposited Roundups
**Purpose:** View investment history and deposited roundups

**Shows:**
- All deposited roundups (`status = true`)
- Total deposited in USD
- Total ETH deposited (calculated from USD / ETH price)
- Number of deposited transactions
- Deposit history table with:
  - Transaction hash (clickable to Blockscout)
  - USDC amount
  - Roundup amount
  - Date deposited

**Info Displayed:**
- "These roundups have been deposited to the smart contract"
- "Earning yield in Aave V3"
- Current ETH/USD price from Oracle

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Created:

1. **`/src/app/hooks/useOraclePrice.js`**
   - React hook to read ETH price from Oracle contract
   - Uses `usePublicClient` from wagmi
   - Reads from `read()` function on your Oracle contract
   - Returns: `{ ethPrice, priceAge, loading, error }`

2. **`/src/app/portfolio/page.js`**
   - Portfolio dashboard component
   - Fetches deposited roundups from API
   - Calculates total deposited
   - Shows deposit history table

3. **`/src/app/api/get-deposited-roundups/route.js`**
   - API endpoint to fetch deposited roundups
   - Queries: `base_batch_roundup` where `status = true`
   - Returns: roundups array and totalDeposited

### Files Updated:

1. **`/src/app/components/DepositCard.js`**
   - Now uses `useOraclePrice()` hook
   - Reads REAL ETH price from Oracle contract
   - No more mock prices!

2. **`/src/app/components/Header.js`**
   - Added "Portfolio" link in navigation
   - Shows only when wallet is connected

## 🎯 User Flow

### Scenario 1: User Has Pending Roundups
```
User connects wallet
    ↓
Goes to Dashboard (/dashboard)
    ↓
Sees pending roundups: $1.25
    ↓
Oracle shows: 1 ETH = $2,500
    ↓
Required ETH: 0.0005 ETH
    ↓
Deposit button ENABLED (total >= $1.00)
    ↓
User clicks "Deposit"
    ↓
All pending roundups marked as status = true
    ↓
Dashboard now shows: $0.00 pending
```

### Scenario 2: User Wants to See Deposited Roundups
```
User connects wallet
    ↓
Clicks "Portfolio" in navigation
    ↓
Portfolio page loads
    ↓
Shows:
  - Total Deposited: $5.75
  - Total ETH: 0.0023 ETH
  - 5 deposited transactions
    ↓
Table shows all transactions with status = true
    ↓
User can click on tx_hash to view on Blockscout
```

### Scenario 3: New User
```
User connects wallet
    ↓
Dashboard: "No transactions yet"
    ↓
Portfolio: "No deposits yet"
    ↓
User makes USDC transfers
    ↓
Dashboard: Shows pending roundups
    ↓
When total >= $1.00, user deposits
    ↓
Portfolio: Shows deposited roundups
```

## 📝 Database Queries

### Dashboard (Pending)
```sql
SELECT * FROM base_batch_roundup
WHERE user_id = ? AND status = false
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Portfolio (Deposited)
```sql
SELECT * FROM base_batch_roundup
WHERE user_id = ? AND status = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

---

## 🔗 Navigation Flow

```
Landing Page (/)
    ↓
    ├─→ Dashboard (/dashboard) - Pending roundups
    │       ↓
    │       └─→ Portfolio (/portfolio) - Deposited roundups
    │
    └─→ Portfolio (/portfolio) - Deposited roundups
            ↓
            └─→ Dashboard (/dashboard) - Back to pending
```

## 🎨 UI Components

### Dashboard Summary Cards:
- **Total Roundups** - Sum of pending (`status = false`)
- **ETH Price** - From Oracle contract
- **Required ETH** - Calculated from roundups / price

### Portfolio Summary Cards:
- **Total Deposited** - Sum of deposited (`status = true`)
- **Total ETH Deposited** - Calculated from USD / ETH price
- **Total Transactions** - Count of deposited roundups

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test Oracle Integration:
- [ ] Dashboard loads ETH price from Oracle contract
- [ ] Price updates every 30 seconds
- [ ] Console shows: "Oracle ETH/USD Price: 2500.123..."
- [ ] Required ETH calculation is correct

### Test Dashboard (Pending):
- [ ] Shows only roundups with `status = false`
- [ ] Total pending is accurate
- [ ] Deposit button disabled when total < $1.00
- [ ] Deposit button enabled when total >= $1.00
- [ ] After deposit, pending roundups disappear

### Test Portfolio (Deposited):
- [ ] Shows only roundups with `status = true`
- [ ] Total deposited is accurate
- [ ] Table displays all deposited transactions
- [ ] Transaction links go to Blockscout
- [ ] Empty state shows when no deposits

### Test Navigation:

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy CoffeeChange smart contract** to Base Sepolia
2. **Update contract address** in DepositCard.js
3. **Uncomment deposit functionality** in DepositCard.js
4. **Test full flow**: Pending → Deposit → Portfolio
5. **Add withdraw functionality** (future feature)

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Deposit

**Before Deposit:**
```
Dashboard:
  - Total Pending: $1.50
  - 3 transactions (status = false)

Portfolio:
  - Total Deposited: $0.00
  - 0 transactions
```

**After Deposit:**
```
Dashboard:
  - Total Pending: $0.00
  - 0 transactions (all marked as status = true)

Portfolio:
  - Total Deposited: $1.50
  - 3 transactions (status = true)
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your implementation is complete when:
1. ✅ Dashboard shows ONLY pending roundups (`status = false`)
2. ✅ Portfolio shows ONLY deposited roundups (`status = true`)
3. ✅ ETH price reads from real Oracle contract
4. ✅ Price updates automatically every 30 seconds
5. ✅ Navigation between Dashboard and Portfolio works
6. ✅ After deposit, roundups move from Dashboard to Portfolio
7. ✅ All calculations (ETH required, total deposited) are accurate
